\section{Introduction}
High-dimensional continuous control tasks, such as humanoid locomotion and robotic stability, challenge reinforcement learning due to their complexity and the risk of early convergence to suboptimal solutions. This study harnesses chaos—unpredictable shifts in policy behavior or environment dynamics—as an information source to guide model convergence. We propose a novel strategy of compartmentalizing environmental chaos and noise into entropy terms embedded in the policy. Drawing on Shannon's measure of uncertainty in policy predictions, akin to thermodynamic and information principles, our algorithms embed environmental variability, such as stochastic dynamics or noise, into policy entropy. This transforms chaotic uncertainty into structured knowledge for enhanced exploration and stability in MuJoCo environments.

We propose a hypothetical relationship between environmental noise injection and entropy, where both act as dual information sources for the algorithm. Noise is analogous to adding information or resolution of the environment, providing meaningful relief, while entropy represents in-model uncertainty, akin to thermodynamic principles in this simulated system. Uniform noise injection on actions and rewards simulates real-world uncertainties, such as wheel slip or inaccurate sensors, enriching the entropy term that captures policy uncertainty without requiring minimization during training.

Primarily, we investigate the impact of these principles and techniques on Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), which generally maintains low, constant entropy with conservative exploration behavior. We introduce Generative Trust Region Policy Optimization (GenTRPO), which integrates PGR, entropy regularization, and mini-batch entropy measurement. These algorithms achieve robust performance in high-dimensional tasks, notably the Humanoid simulation.

Our experiments compare GenTRPO and GenTRPO with Noise against TRPO as baseline, across MuJoCo environments including Humanoid-v5 and HumanoidStandup-v5, using mini-batch updates to measure entropy and assess noise resilience. This study advances the understanding of how chaos, noise, and entropy, inspired by principles of disorder and information, enhance performance in challenging continuous control tasks.

\section{Methods}
We evaluate three models: (1) Standard TRPO as the baseline, which optimizes policies under trust region constraints to ensure stable updates. (2) GenTRPO, which integrates prioritized generative replay (PGR), entropy regularization, and mini-batch entropy measurement to enhance exploration and sample efficiency. The generative component relies on a forward dynamics model to create synthetic transitions, complementing real experiences. (3) GenTRPO w/ Noise, which adds uniform noise injection to actions and rewards to simulate real-world uncertainties and promote robustness.

Experiments use MuJoCo environments with default hyperparameters: learning rate 0.001, batch size 2048, over 100,000 timesteps. Metrics include max reward, mean reward ± std, and timestep at max (proportional index). Entropy is tracked for policy uncertainty. Noise levels are empirically set to span beneficial ranges. Results are averaged over five independent runs for statistical reliability.

\section{Results Analysis}
In this report, we analyze the performance of the models based on the computed metrics. The best performing model is determined by the highest maximum reward. We critically evaluate the convergence speed, entropy behavior, and overall stability. Entropy analysis follows standard practices where decreasing entropy indicates policy sharpening and reduced exploration, while the rate of change at peak reward highlights stability or rapid adjustments. The results are representative of five independent training runs, ensuring statistical significance, and are in line with RL literature best practices.

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, GenTRPO models outperform the TRPO baseline in both environments, with notable gains in HumanoidStandup-v5. These improvements suggest that generalizations and noise aid in handling complex dynamics.
