\section{Statistical Significance Against Baseline}
This section evaluates the statistical significance of each algorithmâ€™s performance compared to its baseline (PPO for GenPPO, TRPO for GenTRPO, TRPOR, TRPOER) using a two-sample t-test. The p-value indicates the likelihood that a noise-trained run outperforms the baseline. For single-run comparisons, a deterministic outcome is reported.
